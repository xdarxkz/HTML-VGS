            <p id="prepare">“Together, we can shake the very stars from the sky.”        </p>
    
          <p id="cia">Elżbieta Bosak is the youngest daughter of respected Jan Bosak, former commander of the Polish Special Operations Forces unit GROM. Like her sister, Zofia, Ela excelled in the grueling training imposed upon them by their father. She attended officers’ school but couldn’t reconcile military life with her need for independence and left to study Fine Arts in Berlin. Her reputation for using military paraphernalia in her art attracted the owner of a small private security company, who offered her a job. She was valued in the private sector for her expertise in survivalist tactics and unique adaptive style during protective detail and intelligence gathering, until her father’s death convinced her to return to Poland and join GROM. Ela is a reliable team player with leadership potential, even if her distrust of authority continues to be a point of contention. Her successful collaboration with SEAL prompted her invitation to join Rainbow.

            <p id="although">We civilians can understand Specialist Elżbieta “Ela” Bosak’s independent nature more than some starch-collared military commander might. Of course, following orders is expected of those within the rank-and-file, and for someone so quick to buck against authority she also expresses a deep respect for the military and her role within it. It’s her autonomy that rubs traditionalists the wrong way, and perhaps her anger. Even at our first meeting, I detected her resolve. She is fighting against something, but it may not be authority – at least not entirely. […]
    
                I won’t dismiss the concerns of commanding officers who mention that Bosak can be impulsive, but I would urge them instead to appreciate her creative resilience. Anyone who has worked with artists can attest to this quality. It manifests in the field in the protection of her team and her high number of successful operations. Her impulsiveness – her adaptability – is the very quality that causes her to excel. […]
                
                Both Ela and her sister, Zofia, carry the deep impression of their father’s influence. Ela is more inclined to accept that her father, though exceptional, wasn’t perfect. In reviewing Commander Jan Bosak’s file, I saw a proud, insightful man. That’s the key. Ela is finely tuned to the patterns and behaviors around her and when she seems defiant it’s because she’s frustrated with those who lack this “vision.” Joining Rainbow, and working with other elite operators, has somewhat tempered this frustration as she no longer feels constrained by the attitudes of those around her. […]
                
                Ela’s defiance extends into her personal life. She isn’t interested in self-improvement, she told me. She was surprised when I said I know about her “volunteer work.” She roams the streets late at night, with food and blankets to hand out, or even just a cigarette. Then she listens. Her conversations with strangers offer fresh perspectives. She stockpiles them, to add to her insight and therefore her skills, but also as fuel for her work. The status quo isn’t what she wants it to be, but that won’t stop her from trying to kick it into shape.
                
                -- Dr. Harishva “Harry” Pandey, Director of Rainbow</p>
